# React Firebase Login Boilerplate

It is a react project + firebase + redux + materilze.css with signin and signup boilerplate. The idea of this is to save time and be focus to build others features or help others to check how to mix all this elements.

Once you installed all the dependencies with
```
yarn install
```

Run the project with this command
```
yarn start
```

## Note

Before run the project you have to create a project on **firebase** you going to use **firestore** as database (this is example case).
After this you have to pick the type of project that way you will have the credentials that will make the connection **firebase** with **the project**

This is the example of the credentials you will have from **firebase**
```
apiKey: API_KEY_CODE",
authDomain: "<NAME_YOUR_PROJECT>.firebaseapp.com",
databaseURL: "https://<NAME_YOUR_PROJECT>.firebaseio.com",
projectId: <NAME_YOUR_PROJECT>
storageBucket: "<NAME_YOUR_PROJECT>.appspot.com",
messagingSenderId: MESSAGINGSENDERID NUMBER",
appId: APP_ID_CODE,
measurementId: MEASUREMENTID_CODE
```

This info is different with each project, so be attent to copy well the info on your project.
